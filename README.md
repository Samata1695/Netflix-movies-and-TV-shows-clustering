**Abstract:** Netflix has been the part of many peopleâ€™s everyday lives especially during the coronavirus crisis. And a new phenomenon called the Netflix Effect reveals how much influence the streaming provider really has.  Recommendation algorithms are at the core of the Netflix product. The algorithms provide their members with personalized suggestions to reduce the amount of time and frustration to find something great content to watch. Because of the importance of their recommendations, Netflix continually seek to improve them by advancing the state-of-the-art in the field. Netflix does this by using the data about what content our members watch and enjoy along with how they interact with our service to get better at figuring out what the next great movie or TV show for them will be. This paper elaborates the importance of various factors influencing the recommendations. The result has been explained by the visualization.
